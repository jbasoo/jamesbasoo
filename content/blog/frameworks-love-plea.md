Open Notepad, write a bunch of weird text and brackets, save as index.html and hey-presto, you have a website.

In an IT class in 2002, this was my intro to web design. Throughout my teenage years my interest waxed and waned, but ultimately the craft gripped me, and I ended up as a front-end developer. I can't count, or even remember, all of the tools and techniques I've used and dropped since that class, but the years have taught me a lot about how to make good tech choices, and what tool makers can do to be useful for as long as possible.

While time has given us an almost infinite number of ways to author and generate websites, the OG method of hand-crafting `.html` files still works today. Some non-standard features have been deprecated (RIP `<blink>`), but if you open that file in any modern browser, it'll still run. If you open that file in any modern editor, it'll still be editable. That's the power of the web platform, it moves slow and breaks almost nothing. The drawback of this stability is that it's **not** fast to explore new ideas, however this is where the plethora of frameworks, libraries, toolkits, and compilers shine.

The lines between them can be a bit blurry and some morph from being one to another over time, but they essentially share the same goal, to make development easier. Some abstract away common patterns, some explore new ways of doing things, and some smooth the rough edges of cross-browser development. In 2024, however, the cracks in many of these tools are starting to show.

## CSS

The past decade has seen CSS mature into an extremely powerful UI engine. The ~~hacks~~ best-practices of yesterday have been abandoned in favour of robust layout and styling mechanisms such as grid, variables, and functions. Many of the ideas [weren't new](https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html), but validating their efficacy would've been difficult without pioneering preprocessors and frameworks popularising them.

### Preprocessors

### Utility Frameworks

## JS

### jQuery

### Component Frameworks

## Conclusion
Frameworks are like the products of mad scientists on the bleeding edge. They explore new things "blazingly fast," but history teaches us that speeding to mass production can have significant downsides. Fossil fuels, CFCs, social media, these creations have had tremendous benefits to society, but it's only after the widespread adoption that we acknowledged that they are also incredibly damaging. The signs may have been there at the beginning, but in our haste we neglected the risks.

Frameworks have also run a similar course. These incredibly powerful tools have allowed us to rapidly accomplish more at the expense of performance, accessibility, and our own personal knowledge of the fundamentals. (?Messing up with power tools typically is typically more catastrophic than messing up with hand tools.?) SUNK COST FALLACY
